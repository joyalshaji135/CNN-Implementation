# CNN-Implementation
A total of 15,153 samples are used in this work. These samples include chest X-ray images of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal cases. The entire dataset was split into train and test sets, with a ratio of 80:20 before training the model. To enhance important image features, image preprocessing and augmentation were applied before feeding the image batches to the model.
